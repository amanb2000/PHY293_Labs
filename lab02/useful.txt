1. remove outliers and state we did so and why

Day2
- b06, r01 goes out of frame at the last portion

- b07, left 2 were too close

- b9, r06, the big chunk

- b10, r01, went in and out a few times, maybe bad?
    - r02, r03 blink too

2. Create a histogram (density/gaussian function)
    - determine 3sigmax to find 99.7% of the data (65 95 99.7 rule) - NEED
    - plot avg (or final?) distance from origin relative per each trial


TO GET PROCESSED DATA:
    1. COPY & PASTE the data folder as is from the Google Drive into lab02 directory
    2. Run lab02/src/pipeline.py
    3. The data is packed in the .pkl file found in lab02/data/readings.pkl
    4. lab02/src/notebook/lab2_processing.ipynb sets up the imported data
